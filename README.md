Create a Java program that calculates the sum of two integers x and y, which
get values through the keyboard. If the calculated amount is a positive even number, the following message is displayed:
The calculated sum is a positive even number, because S= 'sum value'. If the calculated amount is
positive odd number, then the value 1 is added to it, and the message is given: The calculated amount was 'presented

sum value', but we converted it to an even number by adding 1 and now K= 'represents the value of K-
of'. Where, K is variable that calculates Sum+1. If the sum is 0, the message is printed: Since

the sum is zero, we are adding the x and y values, and we get the sum: 'sum value is displayed'.
While, for the other cases of the amount, print the message, there cannot be many negatives, you
please change the values of x or y variables.
